# passwordGenerator

This is a simple password generator.
The apps desiered function is to create a random password with the users choice of length/characters/numbers/and symbols.
When prompted the user is asked a series of questions about their desired password,
once they are done answering questions the app will automatically produce a random password

This app was created by me, Jennifer Vereecken
